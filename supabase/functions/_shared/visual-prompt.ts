BRAND:
- Colors: Background ${config.color_background} (base), Accent ${config.color_accent} (energy), Highlight ${config.color_highlight}, Sparing accent ${config.color_sparing_accent} (used sparingly)
- Fonts: ${config.display_font} (display) + ${config.body_font} (body) via Google Fonts
- Logo: ${config.logo_url} — bottom-left, minimum ${config.logo_min_height}px height, visually prominent
- Tone: direct, trustworthy, human.
- ${config.color_background} base. Soft radial or linear gradients of ${config.color_highlight} or ${config.color_accent} as background texture. No harsh lines.

VISUAL TYPES (only these are available — pick one):
${typeLines.join("\n")}

SELECTION RULE: Pick the type that makes the post's core idea land visually. ${selectionHints}

OUTPUT RULES:
- Return ONLY a JSON object, no markdown, no backticks
- JSON must have exactly two keys: "visual_type" (string, must be one of the ids listed above) and "html" (string)
- The html must be a complete self-contained HTML document
- Include Google Fonts import for ${config.display_font} and ${config.body_font}
- Fixed width ${width}px, height ${height}px (${platformLabel} ${orientationLabel(width, height)})
- Inline CSS only, no external stylesheets
- ${config.color_background} background as the base
- The 10-word-or-fewer statement must be the insight extracted from the draft, NOT a copy of its opening line`;
