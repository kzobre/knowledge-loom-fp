-- Knowledge Loom seed, sourced exactly from the design mockups:
--   mockups/prismm-strategy-page-mockup-v2.html
--   mockups/prismm-audience-page-v3.html
--
-- This is a clean REPLACE for the single user in the project: it clears the prior
-- library rows and inserts the mockup content verbatim. Re-runnable.
--
-- Hard rules held: no em-dashes anywhere; the brand description is reworded off the
-- mockup's "secure digital vault" line into inheritance-infrastructure language, no
-- vault and no probate; brand colors coral #f9655b, purple #6658ea, gold #f5c070
-- (navy #1b2b45 is the ink color, not a profile field).
--
-- Note: the mockups define no seed-bank premises, so the seeds table is intentionally
-- left empty here (the prior placeholder premises are removed).
--
-- The hard_rules / voice_profile / reference_cards section at the end of this file was
-- moved here from supabase/migrations/20260614170000_strategy_source_of_truth.sql during
-- the Phase 2b hardcode/multi-tenancy audit fix, unchanged, so that migrating a fresh
-- database no longer implicitly seeds Prismm's own content into its first user -- running
-- this file by hand is now the only way to reproduce it.
